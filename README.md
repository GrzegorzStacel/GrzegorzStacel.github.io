# GrzegorzStacel.github.io

This is my 1# first page.
As part of the training, I copied it in ~ 90% from another site.
I did not copy it 1:1 because I did not like some solutions or wanted to practice other solutions, so I introduced my small "improvements", among others:

1. Instead of basing rwd on bootstrap, I did all flex responsiveness

2. I added other animations and some additional ones.
3. I used fewer libraries and implemented other ones:
    - lightboxes
    - owlCarusel2
    - ScrollReveal

The original page can be found at this link:
